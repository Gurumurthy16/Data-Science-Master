    "Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) is used in continuous probability distributions to describe the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a certain range of values. The PDF provides a curve that integrates to 1 over its entire domain and represents the relative likelihood of different outcomes."

    "Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",

    "Q4. What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial\n",
    "distribution can be applied.\n",
    "The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments) with the same probability of success. Here are some properties of the binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Number of Trials:** The binomial distribution applies to a fixed number of trials, denoted as \"n,\" where each trial is independent of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two Possible Outcomes:** Each trial has two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as \"S\") or failure (usually denoted as \"F\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constant Probability of Success:** The probability of success on each trial is denoted as \"p,\" and the probability of failure is \"1 - p.\" This probability remains constant across all trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independent Trials:** The outcomes of the trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discrete Distribution:** The binomial distribution is discrete, meaning it applies to whole numbers of successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** The PMF gives the probability of observing a specific number of successes in \"n\" trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Mean and Variance:** The mean (expected value) of the binomial distribution is given by \"np,\" and the variance is \"np(1 - p).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Events Where Binomial Distribution Can Be Applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coin Flips:** When flipping a fair coin multiple times, each flip can be considered a Bernoulli trial. The binomial distribution can be used to model the number of heads obtained in a fixed number of coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality Control:** In manufacturing, the binomial distribution can be used to model the number of defective items in a sample of a fixed size. For instance, if you're inspecting a batch of light bulbs to determine how many are defective, each bulb can be considered a trial, and the number of defective bulbs can be modeled using the binomial distribution."

    "Q7. How Binomial distribution different from Poisson distribution?\n",
    "The binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution are both discrete probability distributions, but they have different characteristics and applications. Here's a comparison of the two distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Trials:** The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two Outcomes:** Each trial in the binomial distribution has two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as \"S\") or failure (usually denoted as \"F\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constant Probability of Success:** The probability of success on each trial is denoted as \"p,\" and the probability of failure is \"1 - p.\" This probability remains constant across all trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independent Trials:** The outcomes of the trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discrete Distribution:** The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution, meaning it applies to whole numbers of successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mean and Variance:** The mean (expected value) of the binomial distribution is given by \"np,\" and the variance is \"np(1 - p).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Events:** The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single Outcome:** Each event in the Poisson distribution has only one possible outcome: the event occurring (usually denoted as \"E\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Average Rate:** The Poisson distribution is characterized by the average rate of occurrence denoted as \"λ\" (lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Independent Events:** The events in the Poisson distribution are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discrete Distribution:** The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution, as it deals with counts of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mean and Variance:** The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to \"λ.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences and Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The binomial distribution is used when we have a fixed number of trials, each with the same probability of success, and we're interested in the number of successes.\n",
    "- The Poisson distribution is used when we're interested in modeling the number of events that occur within a specific interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Binomial: Modeling the number of heads obtained in a fixed number of coin flips.\n",
    "- Poisson: Modeling the number of phone calls received by a call center in a fixed interval of time, given an average rate of calls per hour."

When \"p\" is close to 0.5, the distribution is symmetric and has its maximum variance. As \"p\" deviates from 0.5 towards 0 or 1, the distribution becomes more skewed and the variance decreases.\n",

    "In summary, the relationship between the mean and variance in the binomial distribution depends on the probability of success \"p,\" while in the Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are always equal.

    "Q10. In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?\n",
    "In a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. This means that the least frequent data points appear in the tails of the distribution, which are the regions located farthest from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution's tails extend to negative and positive infinity, and they become increasingly rare as you move away from the mean in either direction. This is because the probability density decreases rapidly in the tails, following the shape of the bell curve.\n",

    "**Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a symmetric bell-shaped probability distribution commonly found in nature and statistics. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and the distribution is fully defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "**Bernoulli Distribution:**\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution models a single binary outcome, typically representing success (1) or failure (0) in a single experiment or trial. It's a discrete distribution often used in situations with two possible outcomes.\n",

    "**Log-Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "The log-normal distribution describes the distribution of a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. It's often used to model quantities that cannot be negative and whose natural logarithms follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. It's often used for rare events, such as the number of phone calls at a call center during a specific time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power Law Distribution:**\n",
    "The power law distribution, also known as a Pareto distribution, describes the distribution of a variable where the frequency of an event is inversely proportional to its magnitude. It's used to model phenomena where a few events have high impact and most have lower impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "The binomial distribution models the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It's often used to represent the probability of achieving a specific number of successes in a series of yes-or-no experiments.\n",
