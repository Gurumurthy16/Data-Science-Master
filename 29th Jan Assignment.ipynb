    "Q1: Python Programming Language was developed by **Guido van Rossum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Python supports **multi-paradigm programming**. It primarily supports **procedural**, **object-oriented**, and **functional** programming. It is known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Yes, Python is **case-sensitive** when dealing with identifiers. This means that variables or function names with different cases (e.g., `myVariable` and `myvariable`) are treated as distinct entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: The correct extension for a Python file is **\".py\"**. For example, \"my_script.py\" is a valid Python file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Python is an **interpreted** language. Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: In Python, you can define code blocks using the following:\n",
    "   - **Functions**: Defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "   - **Conditional Statements**: Such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` for branching logic.\n",
    "   - **Loops**: Including `for` and `while` loops for iteration.\n",
    "   - **Classes**: Defined using the `class` keyword to create objects and encapsulate behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: The character **\"#\"** is used to give **single-line comments** in Python. Anything following a \"#\" on a line is treated as a comment and is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: To find the version of Python you are currently working on, you can use the `sys` module's `sys.version` attribute or the `platform` module's `platform.python_version()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import platform\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Python version (sys):\", sys.version)\n",
    "print(\"Python version (platform):\", platform.python_version())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Python supports the creation of **anonymous functions** at runtime using a construct called **\"lambda\"**. Lambda functions are also known as **anonymous or inline functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: **PIP** stands for **Python Package Index**. It is a package manager for Python that allows you to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11: Some built-in functions in Python include `print()`, `len()`, `range()`, `input()`, `type()`, `int()`, `str()`, `float()`, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12: The maximum possible length of an identifier (variable or function name) in Python is **unlimited**. However, it is recommended to keep identifiers reasonably short and meaningful for code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13: Benefits of using Python include:\n",
    "   - **Readability**: Python's clean and easy-to-read syntax.\n",
    "   - **Versatility**: Supports multiple programming paradigms.\n",
    "   - **Large Standard Library**: A wide range of built-in modules and libraries.\n",
    "   - **Community and Support**: Active and large user community.\n",
    "   - **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various platforms.\n",
    "   - **Open Source**: Python is freely available and can be customized.\n",
    "   - **Diverse Applications**: Used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, scripting, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14: Memory in Python is managed using a combination of **automatic memory management** (via reference counting) and a **garbage collector** that reclaims memory that is no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15: To install Python on Windows and set path variables, follow these steps:\n",
    "   1. Download the Python installer from the official Python website.\n",
    "   2. Run the installer and select the option to add Python to the system PATH during installation.\n",
    "   3. Complete the installation process.\n",
    "   4. Open a command prompt and type `python` to verify the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16: Yes, **indentation is required** in Python. Indentation is used to define code blocks and is a fundamental part of Python's syntax. It is used to group statements within functions, loops, and conditional blocks."
