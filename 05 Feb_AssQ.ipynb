    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods (functions) together within a class. It involves hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface to interact with it. Encapsulation allows for data abstraction and protects the internal state of an object from direct external access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class. It promotes code reusability and enables the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. The derived class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods of the base class (superclass) and can add its own specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or function call in different ways. It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on the essential features of an object or a class while hiding unnecessary details. It allows us to create abstract classes or interfaces that define the common structure and behavior of related objects without providing specific implementation details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and provides a higher level of understanding and modularity in program design."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a reference to the instance of a class. It is a convention used in many object-oriented languages, including Python, to refer to the current object within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `self` is the first parameter of instance methods in a class. When a method is called on an object, `self` is automatically passed as the first argument to that method. By convention, `self` is the name used for this parameter, but you can choose any valid name for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of `self` is to allow instance methods to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the object they belong to. It provides a way for methods to refer to the specific instance of the class on which they are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "person.update_age(30)\n",
    "person.display_info()  # Output: Name: John, Age: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `self` parameter is used in the `__init__()` method to set the `name` and `age` attributes of the object. The `self` parameter allows the method to refer to the specific instance of the class and access its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the `display_info()` method and the `update_age()` method, `self` is used to access the attributes (`name` and `age`) of the object and perform actions on them. Without `self`, the methods would not have a way to refer to the object's attributes or other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `self` allows for encapsulation and proper object-oriented design. It ensures that each instance of a class has its own set of attributes and can be manipulated independently. By using `self`, you can access and modify the state of an object within its methods, making it a fundamental part of OOP in Python."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class, parent class, or superclass, and the class that inherits from it is called the derived class, child class, or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reusability and facilitates the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class, and it can add its own specific attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single base class. It forms a linear hierarchy where the derived class extends the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects and invoking methods\n",
    "animal = Animal()\n",
    "animal.sound()  # Output: Animal makes a sound\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.sound()  # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Animal` class is the base class, and the `Dog` class is the derived class. The `Dog` class inherits the `sound()` method from the `Animal` class, and it overrides the method with its own implementation. The `dog.sound()` invocation calls the `sound()` method of the `Dog` class, printing \"Dog barks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple base classes. It allows the derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Flyable:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can fly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Swimmable:\n",
    "    def swim(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can swim\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Duck(Flyable, Swimmable):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating object and invoking methods\n",
    "duck = Duck()\n",
    "duck.fly()  # Output: Can fly\n",
    "duck.swim()  # Output: Can swim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Duck` class inherits from both the `Flyable` and `Swimmable` classes using multiple inheritance. The `Duck` class inherits the `fly()` method from the `Flyable` class and the `swim()` method from the `Swimmable` class. The `duck.fly()` and `duck.swim()` invocations call the respective methods, producing the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class. It forms a chain of inheritance, where each derived class becomes the base class for the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can drive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def park(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can park\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar(Car):\n",
    "    def accelerate(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can accelerate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating object and invoking methods\n",
    "car = SportsCar()\n",
    "car.drive()  # Output: Can drive\n",
    "car.park()  # Output: Can park\n",
    "car.accelerate()  # Output: Can accelerate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `SportsCar` class is derived from the `Car` class, which itself is derived from the `Vehicle` class. The `SportsCar` class inherits the `drive()` method from the `Vehicle` class and the `park()` method from the `Car` class. It also adds its own method, `accelerate()`. The object `car` of the `SportsCar` class can invoke all the inherited and defined methods, producing the expected output."
