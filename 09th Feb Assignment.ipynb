    "**Q1: Create a vehicle class with instance variables `name_of_vehicle`, `max_speed`, and `average_of_vehicle`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Python code for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, average_speed):\n",
    "        self.name_of_vehicle = name\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's the code for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",

    "**Q3: What is multiple inheritance? Write Python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance in Python occurs when a class inherits from more than one base class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def method_A(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method A from class A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def method_B(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method B from class B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A, B):\n",
    "    def method_C(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method C from class C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object of class C\n",
    "obj_c = C()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access methods from both class A and B\n",
    "obj_c.method_A()  # Output: Method A from class A\n",
    "obj_c.method_B()  # Output: Method B from class B\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, class `C` inherits from both class `A` and class `B`, demonstrating multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: What are getter and setter in Python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and setter methods are used to access and modify private attributes of a class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__age = age    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter methods to access private attributes\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter methods to modify private attributes\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
    "        if age >= 0:\n",
    "            self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object of the Student class\n",
    "student = Student(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use getter methods to access private attributes\n",
    "print(student.get_name())  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(student.get_age())   # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use setter methods to modify private attributes\n",
    "student.set_name(\"Bob\")\n",
    "student.set_age(30)\n",
    "print(student.get_name())  # Output: Bob\n",
    "print(student.get_age())   # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: What is method overriding in Python? Write Python code to demonstrate method overriding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create instances of Dog and Cat\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the speak method for each instance\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` classes override the `speak` method inherited from the `Animal` class with their specific implementations."
